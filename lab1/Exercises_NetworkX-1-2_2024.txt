 1) Write a full graph of 50 nodes where from each node, there is a link (either in-going or out-going links) to one to 4 other nodes, taken at random, of your choice. 
    Use a labelling of your choice to label each node of the network.
 
 a) -  Use a visualization tool to display the graph     
 
 b) -  Use a visualization of your choice to display the nodes each node is linked to

 c) -  Calculate the degree centrality of each node and the average degree of the graph  (use appropriate functions in 
    NetworkX) and display their values

 d) - Draw the degree distribution plot and comment on whether the power-law distribution is fit 

 e) - Test other centrality measures available in NetworkX and display their values, and store the centrality values 
      in a vector

 f) - write a script that randomly removes one node from the above graph

     - Repeat the process a)-d)  until the number of nodes in the graph is equal to one.

 g ) Display a graph showing the variations of the various centrality measures as a function of the number of 
edges in the graph.


 2) Use the provided dataset karate_club_coords.pkl.   
   Write a program that 
   
  a) Inputs the above dataset 
  b) Displays the adjacency matrix of this graph and the network associated to this dataset
  c) Calculates the degree centrality of each node and store them in an array vector
  d) Identifies potential regular graphs in the network. 
  e) Uses appropriate NetworkX functions to identify the largest component of the graph, and smallest component. 
  f) Draw the degree distribution of this component (subgraph of d)). 
  g) Use appropriate NetworkX functions to compute the diameter of the whole network and diameter of the largest component.
